We've split up the encoder model for clarity when defining it, 
but have left in a combined model for legacy support.

The next steps are to look at better approaches with forward hooks. 


We can also reconsider how we're implementing our distributed system ->
At the moment, it's a bit of a hack, but it's a good start. 
We use a round robin between different loaders and sets of parameters 
(we could reload params as per v1, but models is nicer for readability)
